### Side Panels

**Editor Side Panel**
For now, you can right click for a regular text node and click Open Editor, and it will display a separate larger editor on the right side (to make the editing easier). Also the changes are sync to the node in the main canvas automatically (with some minimum delays). 


**Paper Side Panel**
For each paper, you can click the expand button and it will open a sidebar of multiple functionalities: 
1. Paper information page
    1. You can click the title and it will navigate to the semantic scholar page 
2. Paper PDF reader (Highlight experimental feature! And don’t use in Safari)
    1. It can load the paper and you can save highlights in the interface. The highlights will be saved and reloaded when you open the paper again. 
    2. Please be slow there as it’s not optimized and might have some latency issues
3. Paper note taking 
    1. You can save specific notes for a paper and it can be used in the follow up generations
