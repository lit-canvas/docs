# `SearchSuggestion` 

Sometimes you have a relatively vague goal for searching. The `SearchSuggestion` implements an interactive process to help you refine the search goal.

Given a high-level key-word like input, the agent generate a list of more fine-grained search questions. 
You can select either one of the questions to execute the search; you can modify each generated questions directly as well. 
Also it supports iterative refinement of the search goal, by simply clicking the Question mark button.
