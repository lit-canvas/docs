# `Search`

The search agent is the "meta" agent that combines the `SearchPaper` and `SearchSuggestion` agent to search for papers.
Given an initial user question, it comes up with a list of more concrete search questions and then uses the `SearchPaper` agent to retrieve the papers. 
This leads to a tree-like structure of the search.
