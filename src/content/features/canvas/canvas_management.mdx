When you first log in to Lit Canvas, you'll see a dashboard displaying your canvases.
You can create a new canvas by clicking the `New Canvas` button.

Three options are available:
1. **Blank Canvas**: Start with an empty workspace
2. **Ask a Question**: Create a canvas with a question paired with the Search Agent
3. **Import**: Upload an existing canvas from a JSON file
